# 🚗 Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

### 🧠 Capstone Project – Summer Analytics 2025  
👤 By: Niladri Banerjee

---

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a real-time **dynamic pricing system** for 14 urban parking lots using Machine Learning models and economic principles. The system intelligently adjusts parking rates based on live demand signals such as:

- Lot occupancy
- Queue length
- Traffic congestion
- Nearby competition

🎯 **Goal:**  
Maximize utilization, reduce congestion, and ensure transparent & fair pricing for users.
